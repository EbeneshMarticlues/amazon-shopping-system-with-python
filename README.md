code defines three classes - Product, ShoppingCart, and Store - to represent products, shopping carts, and the store itself. The Store class contains methods for adding and removing products, displaying products and the shopping cart, and checking out. The main function of the code creates some example products, adds them to the store, and allows the user to add items to their cart and check out. Note that this is a very simplified example and a real-world Amazon-like shopping system would have many more features and complexities.
